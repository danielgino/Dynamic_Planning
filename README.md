# Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) - Dynamic Programming Solution

##  Problem Description
Given an array `V` of size `n` containing natural numbers, find the **length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS)**.  
The subsequence does **not** have to be contiguous — only strictly increasing.

### Example:

## Input:
```
        int[] original = {12, 5, 18, 7, 19, 8, 10};
```

One possible longest increasing subsequence is:
[5, 7, 8, 10] → Length = 4


## Output
```
Longest increasing subsequence length: 4
Total Cost :O(N^2)
```
